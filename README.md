Disclaimer:

As a beginner learning JavaScript this was a valuable guided project courtesy of CodeCademy.

I found this project really valuable becuase it brings fundamental principles togehter.

Some of the things that I learnt include: functions, for loop, if statements, switch statements & methods like forEach(), slice(), reverse()
